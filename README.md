  Fig: Here's the recipe:
  1. ~~Make a create-a-biome-object class(class Biome).</h2>~~

  2. Then create the sensors' data:
  - ~~The sensors' data:<br>- int temp; int umi; int coTwo.~~
      - ~~Those should be on their own classes~~
  
  3. Then the routines methods.:<br>
  - ~~The sensors' Data Structure:<br>~~
    -  ~~int[][] RegTemp, int[][] RegUmi,int[][] RegCODois.<br>~~
  
  - ~~Each of them have an associated time of reading,which is made each half hour.<br>~~
>Ex: sysout(RegUmi) -> "umi - 00:30"<br>
    sysout(RegCODois) -> "coTwo - 12:00"<br>

For each Data Structure, they follow specific rules of sorting:<br>
  1. ~~RegUmi should be sorted in an descending order.~~
  2. ~~RegTempo and RegCODois should be sorted in ascending order.<br>~~
  3. ~~When registering values, they must also be printed at the same time.<br>~~
  4. ~~All Data Structure must have an max of 48 rows.~~
