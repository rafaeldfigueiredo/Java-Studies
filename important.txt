You have been invited to participate in a project that aims to study the reactions
    of people isolated in a biome.
    Its function will be to record the information generated by three groups of sensors,
    within a controlled environment.
    For this, consider that the sensors are spread throughout all spaces of the
    environment and seek to record the temperature (int temp), humidity (int umi) and the amount of gas
    carbonic(int coTwo). Therefore, according to the information mentioned, you must:
    
    — create routines that record the data sent by these sensors in each
    environment space;
    — create data structures that will serve to store the presented value
    for each sensor and the time of reading (time);(int[][] tempReg)(int[][] umiReg)(int[][] coTwo)
    
    Important:
    — To guide you in the preparation of your activity, I highlight that:
    you must use matrix to implement these structures, creating at least one
    specific class for each structure;
    
    — After each record stored, one or more algorithm(s) of
    sorted to present sorted data, descending for humidity
    and increasingly for temperature and CO₂, showing at the end of the routine of
    two;
   
    — Arrays or matrices must have a maximum of 48 rows and records must
    be done every half hour of the day.
